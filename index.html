        <h2>Here's a time-line of his Life..</h2>

      <section id="tribute-info">
        <p>A very simple person who lived an unpretentious lifestyle. He had a keen interest in literature 
          and wrote poems. He never married. <br>He always faced media himself for his failures while let others
           address for the success. He remained active till the very end. <br>He died while delivering a lecture at 
           the IIM.
          <br><br> He was a great mind and an inspiration to many. His words were often wise and full of meaning. 
          When it comes to inspirational personalities, few are as revered as APJ Abdul Kalam. The former President
           of India was known for his humanitarian work and dedication to education, and his words have inspired 
           people around the world.
